PyTorch for Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Study Guide
This repository serves as a personal log and a collection of code exercises for the "Zero to Mastery" PyTorch for Deep Learning course. It is designed to provide a structured path for mastering PyTorch, from fundamental tensor manipulations to building and training complete neural network models.

ðŸš€ Key Learning Objectives
Upon completion of the material in this repository, you will be able to:

Master the fundamentals of PyTorch, including tensor creation, manipulation, and advanced operations.

Understand and implement the complete machine learning workflow, from data preparation to model deployment.

Build, train, and evaluate deep learning models for tasks like linear regression.

Develop device-agnostic code to seamlessly leverage GPUs for accelerated training.

Implement best practices for model persistence, including saving and loading trained models for inference.

Syllabus Breakdown
The repository is organized into two primary modules, following the course structure.
